Write a program that 
- receives the full path to the folder as input;
- collects a list of all files in this folder (non-recursively possible), as well as their properties (size/time of creation, modification, access/archive, read-only, etc.), a list of properties of your choice, at least 2 in addition to the file name;
- outputs a “report” on the contents of the folder to a file in txt, csv, xml, json format - any 2 or more of your choice.
